BuyXR is a tech startup seeking to create an online shopping experience in VR. Their shopping cart functionality is built on a Django backend. 

For processing user payments, integrate the Stripe API into the boilerplate Django application. The solution should include a button labeled “purchase” on new HTML page which you create. Once the button is pressed, it should process the transaction via a user’s payment information. This can either be implemented with a frontend solution which you build out, or through redirecting the user to Stripe’s completion page.

Use test Stripe API keys in your solution. Assume that there is one product being sold with a one-time cost. Create an additional page where you notify the user that their transaction was completed successfully.
